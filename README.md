This is my first project in web development
 I created a web application using the springtoolsuit4 framework, utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript for front end development.
 The CRUD system uses JavaScript and Java for the backend, allowing admins to manage data with unique IDs in the MySql Workbench database using the JPA Repository.
 Thymeleaf fetches details from MySQL for the staff login page, including product information and table count. Billing is calculated through JavaScript
